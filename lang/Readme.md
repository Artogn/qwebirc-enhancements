#Localization

Localization will request files based on the `Accept-Language` in a http request

Requires a server with localization (see [this commit](https://github.com/megawac/iris/commit/fed82b8a6a4c9168fda4ee12a657fde5bddfc337))

Files in this directory will be converted to minified json in the build step.
